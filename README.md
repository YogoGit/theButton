# The Button

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the following frameworks and utilities.

- Play! Framework
- Spring Dependency Injection
- Hibernate JPA w/ MySQL
- SLF4J Logging
- Unit Testing

The Base template for this project was built off of James Wardâ€™s play/java/spring/ebean tutorial found at https://github.com/jamesward/play-java-spring.

To run the app, you must have the application.conf file configured correctly for the database you will have to create, you also must have the sbt build tool installed.
